# QR Code Generator.
## Problem
The goal of this project is to make an easy-to-use, deployable, compute efficient, and brandable qr code generator.

Most online generators make your QR code expire. So instead of linking your direct link they make re-directs. This is good for shortterm QR codes, but is horrible for things that you want control over (example stickers).

Our generator takes your link, or other encodable data, and embeds it directly into the QR code. It also has the free feature of adding your brand to the QR code.

## Goals
